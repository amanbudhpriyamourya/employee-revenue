# Predict-Employee-Turnover
Predicting Employee Turnover with scikit-learn

Dataset - Downloaded from kaggle made by HR of a company
Platform Used - Google Colab

In this project my focus was on three learning objectives:

- Apply decision trees and random forests with scikit-learn to classification problems.
- Interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importance plots.
- Tune model hyperparamters to improve classification accuracy.
- Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using widgets.

By the end of this project, i was be able to apply decision trees and random forest models using scikit-learn and Python to build an employee churn prediction application with interactive controls.


The  project on Predict Employee Churn with Decision Trees and Random Forests is divided into the following tasks:

- Task 1: Introduction and Import Libraries
    Introduction to the data set and the problem overview.
    Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

- Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
    Load the employee dataset using pandas
    Explore the data visually by graphing various features against the target with Matplotlib.

- Task 3: Encode Categorical Features
    The dataset contains two categorical variables: Department and Salary.
    Create dummy encoded variables for both categorical variables.

- Task 4: Visualize Class Imbalance
    Use Yellowbrick's Class Balance visualizer to create a frequency plot of both classes.
    The presence or absence of a class balance problem will inform your sampling strategory while creating training and validation sets.

- Task 5: Create Training and Validation Sets
    Split the data into a 80/20 training/validation split.
    Use a stratified sampling strategy

- Tasks 6 & 7: Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls
    Use the interact function to automatically create UI controls for function arguments.
    Build and train a decision tree classifier with scikit-learn.
    Calculate the training and validation accuracies.
    Display the fitted decision tree graphically.

- Task 8: Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls
    Use the interact function again to automatically create UI controls for function arguments.
    To overcome the variance problem associated with decision trees, build and train a random forests classifier with scikit-learn.
    Calculate the training and validation accuracies.
    Display a fitted tree graphically.

- Task 9: Feature Importance Plots and Evaluation Metrics
    Many model forms describe the underlying impact of features relative to each other.
    Decision Tree models and Random Forest in scikit-learn, feature_importances_ attribute when fitted.
    Utilize this attribute to rank and plot the features.
